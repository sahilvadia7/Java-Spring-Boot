I'm currently following the "Master Java, Spring 6 and Spring Boot 3 with JDBC, JPA, Security, Docker and Microservices" course from Telusko on Udemy. This course is designed to provide a deep understanding of Java and Spring Boot, as well as essential skills in database interactions using JDBC and JPA, implementing security measures, and working with Docker for containerization. Additionally, it covers the principles of microservices architecture, which is crucial for building scalable and efficient applications.

I upload my practice code to GitHub to keep track of my progress and receive feedback from the developer community. This helps me to continually improve my coding skills and ensures that I am following best practices. I welcome contributions and pull requests for improvements, as I believe that collaboration and community engagement are key to learning and growth in the field of software development. If you see any areas for enhancement or have suggestions, please feel free to contribute. Your insights are greatly appreciated!
