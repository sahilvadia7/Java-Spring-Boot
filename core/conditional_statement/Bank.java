// In this scenario, a bank wants to determine if a person is eligible for a loan based on certain conditions:

// The person must be at least 18 years old.
// The person must have a minimum monthly income of $2,000.
// If the person has a credit score of 700 or higher, they automatically qualify for the loan regardless of age and income.
